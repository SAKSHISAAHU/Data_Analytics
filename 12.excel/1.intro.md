# **Excel**
- It is mainly used for data storage.
- To create a table in excel, atleast one column or record is required without that it is not possible.
- The cell nomenclusture is done using "column + row" and each cells have values inside them.
- There are various tabs in excel like Home, Insert, Page Layout, Formulas etc.
- When we move from left to right alphabet increases and on top to bottom number increases of the cells.
- 'Paste Special' is used for special pasting,
    - like a column is creted by adding up two column when we copy and paste it to differnt place then the values of that created column shows error because it dosent support the addition as the cell name is change.
- In **home tab**,
    - **"Font section"** is used for changing or modifying the size, color and style of the cell and value of the cell.
    - **"alignment section"** is used for modifying the cell's size, alignment and value's position.
    - **"style section"** is used for conditional formating mean based upon condition highlighting  the cell.

### **data exploration**
1. renaming column
    - any column name is wrong, we rename it just by double clicking on that cell.

2. unique value
    - to check the unique value of a column,
        - select that column, then select filter on drill down all the unique value will be shown.

3. value count
    - select the column then select 'sort & filters', then on drill dowm on column_name tick mark on specifc category whose value count you want to see then call the records of that category will be seperated and on the bottom right corner we can see the count of that specific category.

4. missing value
    - select a cell then write a function '=countblank()' inside that give the column values
    - to extract the missing value first select the column then click on conditional formating then new rule then select 'format that contains' then on format option choose any color then apply and then on drill down of that column click 'choose filter by color'.

5. wrong data
    - from unique value we check if a column have wrong data or not.
    - to extract wrong value, on seeing unique just tick only on wrong data it will be seperated then.

6. wrong data type
    - there is no concept of data type in excel.

### **functions for data exploration**
1. count() -- only count the column which contains numbers
2. counta() -- count the no. of cells that are not empty
3. countblank() -- count blank cells only
4. len() -- count the no. of character a string have
5. average()
6. mode()
7. median()
8. min()
9. max()
10. stdev() -- calculate sample std dev
11. stdevp() -- calculate population std dev
12. percentile(range,k) -- k= 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1
