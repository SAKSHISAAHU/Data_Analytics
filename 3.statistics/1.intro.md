## **Types of data based upon sourse**
### 1. Structured Data :-
### 2. Unstructured Data :-

## **Types of data based upon nature**  o 
### 1. Qualitative
### 2. Quantitative

## Popoulation :- 
- It is the entire group that we want to draw conclusion about.
- It is represnted by **N**
- Statistical measures applied on population data are called **population parameters** (a numerical value that describes a characteristic of an entire population).

## Sample :-
- A part from population is called sample data.
- It is represnted by **n**
- It range from **n =[2 , n-1]** both included
- Statistical measures applied on sample data are called **sample statistics** (a numerical value that describes a characteristic of population parameter)

## **Types of Statistics**
### 1. Discriptive Statistics :-
- used to describe given data.

### 2. Inferential Statistics :-
- helps us to make estimation or predictions or inferences about a population parameter based on a sample statistics.
