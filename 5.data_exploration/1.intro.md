## DATA EXPLORATION
- Data Exploration is the process of examining your dataset in depth to:
   - Understand its structure
   - Discover patterns and relationships
   - Identify outliers and missing values

- Whatever we have observe in here we will resolve them in data cleaning process.

- Irrespective of size of records we do observation of large datasets as we do for small size records.

- So observe, 
   - **wrong data** = df.unique()
   - any **wrong datatypes** = df.dtypes
   - any **duplicates** = df.duplicated().sum()
   - **outliers** = boxplot
   - **skewness** = df[].skew()
   - df.info()
   - **statistical measure** = df.describe()
   - **shape** = df[].shape()
   - **unimportant columns**
   - whether each column belongs to either of continous, discrete or time-series data by observation based on internal value + column name.

      - As for always continous column will only have 'float' and 'int' datatypes, it should not have 'string' datatype, as continous mean flow of numbers
         - Ex (in value) :- 10, 55, 99, 0.05, 0.1, etc
         - Ex (in category) :- Money, Length, Volume, Weight, Temprature, Energy, Area, Speed, Time(in hours, minutes, seconds).
